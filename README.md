# Sankegame

Objective: The primary objective of the Snake game is to control a snake on the screen and guide it to eat food (often represented as apples or other items). As the snake consumes food, it grows longer. The game's goal is to achieve the highest possible score by eating as much food as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the game's boundaries.

Game Elements:

Snake: The player controls a snake that moves around the game board. The snake starts with a single segment and increases in length as it consumes food.
Food: Food items, typically represented as apples, appear randomly on the game board. The snake needs to "eat" these food items to grow longer and score points.
Obstacles: Some versions of the game may include obstacles or barriers that the snake must navigate around.
Gameplay:

The player can control the snake's movement, usually using arrow keys or other input methods.
The snake moves continuously in the direction it was last directed until it changes direction or collides with something.
Collisions:
Colliding with the game boundaries (walls) or obstacles results in game over.
Colliding with the snake's own body also leads to game over.
Eating food increases the snake's length and earns points.
Scoring: Players typically receive one point for each piece of food consumed. The score may be displayed on the screen.

Difficulty: Snake games often become progressively more challenging. As the snake grows longer, it becomes harder to avoid collisions with walls or its own body. The game may speed up as the player's score increases.

Game Over: The game ends when the snake collides with an obstacle, its own body, or the game boundaries. At this point, the player's final score is displayed, and they may be given the option to start a new game.

Variations: There are numerous variations of the Snake game, each with its own unique features and twists. Some versions may include power-ups, teleportation portals, or different types of food with varying point values.

History: Snake is one of the earliest arcade games, first introduced in the late 1970s on arcade machines. It gained widespread popularity when it was included as a pre-installed game on Nokia mobile phones in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Modern Versions: In addition to classic versions of the game, there are modern iterations available on various platforms, including mobile devices and web browsers, often with enhanced graphics and additional features.

The simplicity and addictive nature of the Snake game have made it a timeless classic in the world of video games. It's also a popular choice for beginner game developers as a starting project due to its relatively straightforward mechanics and rules.
